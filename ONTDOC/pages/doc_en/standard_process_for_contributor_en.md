#### (1) Personal Developer or Group Technical contributions

##### 1. Proposals

Login to GitHub [OEPs](https://github.com/ontio/OEPs) to view existing proposals and make new proposals. New proposals must be prototyped. The Ontology technical committee evaluates proposals and their prototype results, then submits projects to the Ontology Council. Pull requests are also welcome for existing proposals with no code implementation. The Ontology Technical Committee evaluates whether to accept the project based on the development application and sends it to the Ontology Council. The Ontology Council will consider giving appropriate incentives if the proposal is a large contribution to Ontology or will have a large impact.

##### 2. Code contribution

After start the project you can start development. Please submit a pull request according to the [GitHub standard processes](https://help.github.com/).

#### (2) Developer community organizational cooperation

The Ontology Council welcomes organizations to discuss [cooperation](https://info.ont.io/cooperation/en) please indicate that you are requesting technical community cooperation. The Ontology Council will carry out reviews based on the proposal, code contributions, and weekly reviews (JIRA will be used for management). Incentives will be distributed to partner institutions on a regular basis. Particularly excellent organizations can be considered for investment from Ontology.
